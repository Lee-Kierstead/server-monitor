Sharing a few of my perspectives on common themes in the developer world.

# My Thoughts On ...

## The Use of PHP Frameworks

I view PHP frameworks, such as Laravel, as useful tools that can significantly streamline a developer‚Äôs work. They offer a structured approach and time-saving features, making them beneficial for managing larger/team projects.

Where possible, I prefer the simplicity of adopting a framework-agnostic approach and coding in pure PHP. This choice grants me more flexibility, especially for smaller projects where a straightforward and adaptable approach is key. While acknowledging the advantages of frameworks, particularly for bigger and more complex tasks, I consistently lean towards recognizing the merits of a versatile, framework-agnostic vanilla PHP coding style, in line with my development philosophy.

## IDE of Choice

My go-to IDE is Visual Studio Code, and it's become an integral part of my development toolkit. The user-friendly interface and extensive customization options make it a top choice for me. Among the key extensions that significantly enhance my coding experience are PHP Intelephense, PHP_CodeSniffer, PHPDoc Generator, PHPUnit, WordPress Hooks IntelliSense, Prettier - Code formatter, PHP Debug, and Live Server. These extensions collectively streamline my workflow, ensuring efficient coding, testing, and debugging processes.

Next up for me will be the GitHub Copilot extension. The potential for this AI-powered code completion tool to enhance productivity and accelerate the coding process is promising.

## The Use of AI in Development

When it comes to the use of AI in development, the question often arises: Is it cheating? My stance is definitely pro-AI; I firmly believe it's not about cheating but rather leveraging advanced tools to enhance the development process.

AI, in my experience, has become an invaluable ally, particularly for tasks like research, code syntax lookups, code review, and code documentation. These applications have significantly enhanced my workflow and efficiency. Rather than viewing it as a shortcut, I see AI as a powerful aid that allows me to focus on more complex problem-solving aspects of development while streamlining routine and time-consuming tasks. It's about using technology to our advantage, making the development journey more productive and rewarding.

## Imposter Syndrome

Imposter Syndrome is a thing for me as a PHP developer, popping up every so often, especially with the fast changes in the tech world. I firmly believe that no developer can know everything ‚Äì claiming to do so probably means lacking self-awareness. However, what keeps me motivated is the thrill of taking on new challenges and learning.

To deal with Imposter Syndrome, I have a two-step approach. First, I look back at a list of my projects, noting the challenges and successes. At the end of the day, I have yet to run into a development challenge that I haven't licked. It's a kind of self-pep talk, reminding me of my progress and ability. Second, I remind myself that every other developer faces similar doubts. Knowing I'm not alone in this struggle helps me gain perspective and face the next challenge with renewed confidence.

## What Motivates Me

At this juncture in my career, money isn't the primary motivator for me. While I value a fair wage, my main driving force lies in the opportunity for new experiences and challenges, as well as my continuous growth as a developer. I wholeheartedly believe in lifelong learning, and for me, the thrill of tackling new problems and expanding my skill set is what keeps me passionate about development.

Equally crucial in my motivation is the culture of the company. I seek an environment where learning from others and sharing my knowledge is encouraged. I want to have fun in the process, contributing to the company's success while enjoying the journey with a team that values collaboration and mutual growth. It's about finding a balance between personal and professional fulfillment and being part of a culture that aligns with my values as a developer and learner.

## Life Outside of Coding

Balancing life outside of coding is important to me. I believe that finding this balance is key to personal happiness, which, in turn, facilitates achieving great things. Without it, productivity, creativity, and energy levels can take a hit, making it harder to accomplish significant goals.

In my daily routine, I make sure to take 5-kilometer walks to refresh my body and mind. Spending quality time with loved ones is a priority, providing a grounding and joyful experience. Playing and advancing my learning on the piano brings me both pleasure and mental stimulation. Additionally, I set aside half an hour each day for self-reflection, helping me assess my goals and personal growth. These activities contribute to a well-rounded life, ensuring that I can bring my best self to both my coding work and personal life.

Oh ‚Ä¶ and of course, the ‚Äúcrazy let loose‚Äù when the time is right! üòä
